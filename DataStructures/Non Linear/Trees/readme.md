Description:
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root. Each node has zero or more child nodes, and a node without children is called a leaf node.

Types:

Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with the left child having a value less than the parent and the right child having a value greater than the parent.
AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree.
Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree with additional properties to ensure balance.
N-ary Tree: A tree where a node can have at most N children.
Advantages:

Reflects hierarchical relationships.
Efficient for search, insert, and delete operations in balanced trees.
Disadvantages:

Can become unbalanced, leading to decreased performance in operations.
