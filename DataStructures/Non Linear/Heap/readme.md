A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a min-heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, while in a max-heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent.

Types:

Min-Heap: The root is the minimum element.
Max-Heap: The root is the maximum element.
Advantages:
