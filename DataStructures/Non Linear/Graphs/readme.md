Description:
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

Types:

Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction.
Undirected Graph: Edges do not have a direction.
Weighted Graph: Edges have weights or costs.
Unweighted Graph: Edges do not have weights.
Advantages:

Models complex relationships such as social networks, maps, and networks.
Disadvantages:

Can be complex to implement and manage.
Operations can be costly in terms of time and space.
