Description:
A trie is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings. It is used for quick retrieval of words, typically in scenarios like auto-suggest or spell-checking.

Advantages:

Efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion of words.
Can handle a large set of strings efficiently.
Disadvantages:

Can consume a lot of memory for large sets of strings.
More complex to implement compared to other data structures.
