Description:
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

Advantages:

Provides average-case O(1) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
Efficient for large datasets.
Disadvantages:

Hash collisions can degrade performance.
Requires a good hash function to distribute keys uniformly.
