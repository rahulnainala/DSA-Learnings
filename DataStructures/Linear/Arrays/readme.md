Description:
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Advantages:

Quick access to elements using an index.
Efficient use of memory when the number of elements is known and fixed.
Disadvantages:

Fixed size; the size of the array cannot be altered after its declaration.
Insertion and deletion operations are costly, as they require shifting of elements.
