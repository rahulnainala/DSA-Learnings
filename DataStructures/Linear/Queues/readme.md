Description:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. The first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Operations:

Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.
Advantages:

Useful in scenarios such as scheduling tasks, handling requests in a network, and managing resources in operating systems.
Disadvantages:

Limited access; only the front and rear elements are accessible.
Can lead to queue overflow if not managed properly.
