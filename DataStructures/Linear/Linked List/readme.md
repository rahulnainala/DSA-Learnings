Description:
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element (node) contains a reference (link) to the next element in the sequence.

Types:

Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
Circular Linked List: The last node points to the first node.
Advantages:

Dynamic size; it can grow or shrink in size.
Easy insertion and deletion of elements.
Disadvantages:

Random access is not allowed; we have to traverse from the head to access any node.
Extra memory is required for storing the pointer (link).
