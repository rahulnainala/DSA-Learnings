Description:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek: Get the top element of the stack without removing it.
Advantages:

Provides control over how data is accessed.
Useful in scenarios such as reversing a string, backtracking algorithms, and expression evaluation.
Disadvantages:

Limited access; only the top element is accessible.
Can lead to stack overflow if not managed properly.
